# BookFlix

A clean, modern library management dashboard built to make running a library easier.

BookFlix helps you track your entire catalog—books, movies, you name it—and manage memberships without the headache. It handles the boring stuff like calculating due dates and fines automatically, so you can focus on the fun part: running your library.

## What's Inside?

*   **Smart Dashboard**: See everything that's happening at a glance.
*   **Easy Cataloging**: Add or update books and movies in seconds.
*   **Membership Tracking**: Keep tabs on who's active, who's expired, and who needs to renew.
*   **Quick Transactions**: Issue and return items in a snap. Fines are calculated for you.
*   **Reports**: Simple lists for active rentals, overdue items, and pending fines.

## Setup

It's a standard MERN stack app (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Install dependencies for both `client` and `server`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Add your MongoDB URI to the server's `.env` file.
4.  Fire it up:
    ```bash
    # Run the backend
    cd server
    npm run dev

    # Run the frontend
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```

That's it. Enjoy!
